    <hr><h2>Introduction</h2><hr>

    <p>Education enhances employment opportunities, but not uniformly. In some areas, people without high-school diplomas have very few opportunities; in others, they are as likely to have a job as people who went to college (although their jobs and salaries will differ). By looking at the spatial variation in employment rates for people with different educational levels, we discover that:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Employment rates vary considerably across America's 3,142 counties: education matters but so does location.</li>
    <li>High employment rates for the most educated do not mean high employment rates for the least educated: a rising tide does not lift all boats.</li>
    <li>There are a few counties with very high or very low employment rates across all educational levels: some places are doing something very right or very wrong.</li>
    </ul>
   	
    <hr><h2>How much does employment vary?</h2><hr>

    <p>Employment rates rise as educational attainment rises: employment rates for peopled aged 25 to 64 was 48% (median county) for those without a high school diploma in 2011&mdash;2015, 66.4% for high-school graduates, 72.9% for those with some college or an associate's degree, and 82.1% for those with a bachelor's degree or higher. But there is considerable variation within each educational level, although the range shrinks as educational levels rise.</p>

    <p>Of course, not all counties are equal: Kalawao County, Hawaii has an adult population of 57, whereas Los Angeles, California has 5.4 million people aged 16 and above. Yet the results are the same if one looks at a population-adjusted distribution (with the possible exception of those with less than a high-school education, where the median is just below the population weighted center). Either way, there is clearly substantial spatial variation in employment rates.</p>

    <hr><h2>Does opportunity cluster?</h2><hr>
    
    <p>Is there a relationship between employment rates at different educational levels? In other words, if a county has high employment rates for people with higher educational levels, is it likely to have high employment rates for people with lower educational levels as well? Do we see a "trickle down" effect?</p>

    <p>The short answer is: no. There is a link between employment rates for the most educated (bachelor's degree or higher) and every other educational level: in statistical terms, we can reject the hypothesis that the coefficient is zero. But the employment rates for the most educated do not tell us much about employment for the least educated&mdash;again, in statistical terms, the r-square is low (for people with less than high school, the r-square is 0.1319). However the relationship becomes stronger as educational levels increase: for high-school graduates, the r-square is 0.2950, and for those with some college, it is 0.3625. Even so, the relationship is weak. Opportunity does not really cluster&mdash;at least not when measured in this way.</p>

    <hr><h2>What places do best&mdash;and worst?</h2><hr>
    <p>Are there counties that do better or worse across all educational levels? In other words, a county might have high employment rates for the most educated but low employment rates for the least educated. Are there places that have high rates for both? Or, even better, for all educational levels?</p>

    <p>The answer is: yes. There are 188 countries that rank in the top quintile (top 20%) across all educational levels; and there are 152 counties that rank in the bottom quintile across all educational. The top performers cluster around a few states: North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Wyoming and Colorado. The bottom performers are more scattered: California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, much of the south, and into Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and New York. Few states have top and bottom performers.</p>

    <p>What separates the top from the bottom performers? They vary in many ways: their racial make-up is different. The bottom performers are more rural, but the top performers are no more urban than the national average. The bottom performers have more government employment and relatively more jobs in agriculture, forestry and mining? Yet these are just correlations&mdash;they do not explain why some places have better or worse outcomes. That requires a deeper investigation into state and local economies and policies. What is clear, however, is that some places are able to provide employment opportunities for people across educational levels; and some places are struggling no matter what a person's employment level. And that, on its own, is worth understanding and studying further. </p>
