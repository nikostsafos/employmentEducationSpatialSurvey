# Education and Employment: A Spatial Survey

Web version: https://nikostsafos.github.io/employmentEducationSpatialSurvey/

Education enhances employment opportunities, but not uniformly. In some areas, people without high-school diplomas have very few opportunities; in others, they are as likely to have a job as people who went to college (although their jobs and salaries will differ). By looking at the spatial variation in employment rates for people with different educational levels, we discover that:

- Employment rates vary considerably across America's 3,142 counties: education matters but so does location.
- High employment rates for the most educated do not mean high employment rates for the least educated: a rising tide does not lift all boats.
- There are a few counties with very high or very low employment rates across all educational levels: some places are doing something very right or very wrong.

The data for this analysis come from the U.S. Census Bureau, 2011-2015 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, S2301, Employment Status: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/.
