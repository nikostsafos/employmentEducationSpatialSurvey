# Education and Employment: A Spatial Survey

Web version: https://nikostsafos.github.io/employmentEducationSpatialSurvey/

Education enhances employment opportunities, but not uniformly&mdash;location matters. In some areas, people without a high-school diploma have few opportunities; in others, they are just as likely to have a job as people who went to college (although their jobs and salaries will differ). If we study the spatial variation in employment rates for people with different educational levels, we discover that high employment rates for the most educated do not mean high employment rates for the least educated&mdash;a rising tide does not lift all boats. And while some places do well and some poorly, there are a few counties with very high or very low employment rates across all educational levels&mdash;these are places that are doing something very right or very wrong.

The data for this analysis come from the U.S. Census Bureau, 2011-2015 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, S2301, Employment Status: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/.
